## Part 1 - B

* Generated k number of points within canvas and move battleship to those locations
* Use rand num genertator to generate these points or just assign values
* Do the simulation as done in part1-a on each of these points

* Now we assume that after t points the gun in battleship is jammed and vertical range is now like the one of an escort ship (why?! *agonizes in pain*)

### *Steps*
1. Max angle of battleship is still 90 
2. Min angle will be 20, i've decided
3. Do the simulation with the same initial conditions as in part-1a and **observe** the difference
4. Save outputs in txt files as done in part-1a
